Initializing and/or updating all submodules:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## VIM Packages

The .vim directory is setup to include VIM packages as submodules.
The three scripts in .vim help to manage the packages.

Pathogen is installed in autoload. This makes the packages work for Vim < 8.0.
Pathogen repo: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
